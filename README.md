# Welcome to Blink

This is a starter agent you can extend and customize. Try chatting with it in the **Chats** tab.

You can see its source code in the **Source** tab.

It can use web search, access GitHub, and Slack. If you didn't configure these, you can open the **Settings** -> **Integrations** tab to configure them now.

To edit the agent: TODO: add command to pull source code from the blink platform.
