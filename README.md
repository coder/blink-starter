# Welcome to Blink

This is a starter agent you can extend and customize. Try chatting with it in the **Chats** tab.

You can see its source code in the **Source** tab.

It can use web search, access GitHub, and Slack. If you didn't configure these, you can open the **Settings** -> **Integrations** tab to configure them now.

## Editing the agent

To edit the agent, install the Blink CLI:

```sh
npm install -g blink
```

and pull the agent's source code from the Blink platform:

```sh
blink pull
```
